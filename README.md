# lein-haml

Leiningen plugin to compile haml files into html

## Usage

FIXME: write

## TODO

* use :root of project to make sure we use the correct files
** remove root from path on display
** there might be an issue with finding haml files
* Allow the use of a specific haml version if specified in the project.clj config
* Create some unit tests for the haml tasks
* add support for lein2 (test it with lein2)
* extract what could be reused for a lein-sass
* create some kind of CI to run against different versions of lein
* Remove all the unnecessary files from the embedded gem (maybe)
