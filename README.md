# lein-haml-sass

Leiningen plugin to compile haml, sass, and scss files.

## Usage

Four tasks available:

* haml: compiles haml files
* sass: compiles sass files
* scss: compiles scss files
* haml-sass: compiles haml, sass, and scss files depending on which
  file types are provided in the `project.clj`

For each task, three subtasks are availbale:

* once: compiles the source files once
* auto: keeps the compiler running and watches for new files and file changes
* clean: cleans the files that were generated by the compiler

## TODO

* document usage of project
* allow minification options
* need to do some kind of perf test
* Allow the use of a specific haml version if specified in the project.clj config
* add support for lein2 (test it with lein2)
* create some kind of CI to run against different versions of lein
* Remove all the unnecessary files from the embedded gem (maybe)
* put colors in the terminal output
